## 🧠 About Me

I am a former **Technical Solution Architect** stepping into the world of **Data Engineering**.

With an MBA, experience in software development, and a project management background in both IT and finance fields, I have spent the last few years building real-world digital solutions — from BPM workflows to AI chatbot solutions — mostly within the SAP and Microsoft ecosystem.

Now, I am diving deeper into **data pipelines**, **cloud architecture**, to help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.
